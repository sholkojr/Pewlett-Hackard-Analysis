The results between titles and department are reasonably consistant, hovering around 30% between titles and departments.  This is a very high number for an organisation and will present a signification challenge to mitigate the negative impacts of loss of technical and organisational experience over the next 5 years.

## Summary
It is recommended that further investigation is undertaken to better understand these problems.  Further queries are recommended in the following areas:
- Developing a better profile of the organization from junior, intermediate to senior employees.
- Identifying long-time employees (both near retirement and long service time) to be set aside for both technical and organisational mentoring.
